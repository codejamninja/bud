## Overview

When `@roots/bud-entrypoints` and `@roots/bud-wordpress-externals` are used together it is necessary to refer to multiple manifests in order to handle assets. This extension provides both extensions and merges their manifest outputs.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @roots/bud-wordpress-manifests --dev
```

## Usage

```js
bud.use(['@roots/bud-wordpress-manifests'])
```

## Configuration

Refer to the [@roots/bud-entrypoints](https://github.com/roots/bud/tree/stable/bud-entrypoints) and [@roots/bud-wordpress-externals](https://github.com/roots/bud/tree/stable/bud-wordpress-externals) documentation for configuration options.
